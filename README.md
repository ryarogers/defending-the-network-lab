# Defending the Network from a Simulated Attack

## Overview
This project documents a hands-on network security lab focused on identifying, exploiting, and mitigating vulnerabilities in a controlled environment. The lab demonstrates how simulated attacks can be used to understand attacker behavior and improve defensive security controls.

The work emphasizes detection, response, and hardening rather than offensive exploitation.

## Objectives
- Simulate a controlled attack against a vulnerable web server
- Analyze attack paths and indicators of compromise
- Remove malicious files using antivirus tools
- Patch exploited systems to prevent reinfection
- Harden network perimeter controls

---

## Tools & Technologies
- Infection Monkey (attack simulation)
- Metasploit (controlled exploitation)
- Linux command line
- Antivirus software
- Firewall configuration (DMZ rules)

---

## Key Security Concepts Demonstrated
- Defense in depth
- Least privilege
- Vulnerability management
- Patch management
- Network segmentation
- Malware detection and remediation
