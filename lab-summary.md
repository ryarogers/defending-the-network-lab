# Lab Summary & Reflection

## Simulated Attack Analysis
A simulated attack was conducted against a vulnerable web server to observe how an attacker could exploit weak configurations. The simulation highlighted how exposed services and outdated software can be leveraged to gain unauthorized access.

## Malware Identification & Removal
Following exploitation, malicious files were identified on the affected system. Antivirus tools were used to detect known signatures and remove infected files, reinforcing the importance of endpoint protection as part of a layered defense strategy.

## System Patching
The compromised system was patched to address the underlying vulnerability. After patching, further exploit attempts were unsuccessful, demonstrating the effectiveness of timely updates and vulnerability remediation.

## Network Hardening
Firewall rules were reviewed and updated to strengthen the network perimeter, particularly within the DMZ. Restricting unnecessary traffic reduced the attack surface and limited lateral movement.

## What I Learned
- Vulnerability exploitation often relies on misconfigurations rather than advanced techniques  
- Patching is one of the most effective security controls  
- Antivirus and endpoint protection remain critical detection mechanisms  
- Network segmentation significantly reduces risk  
- Layered defenses improve detection and response
